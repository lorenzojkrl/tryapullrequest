## What Can You Do?

More or less, anything you want.
For example, you can:

- Add your own name and info to the table
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to style your row
- Use JSX to create a new React component. In this case:
  - Name the component with your Github profile name (add numbers if many components)
  - Create the component in the `components` folder
  - Add the component in `App.tsx` under the table

However, I will not accept:

- Offensive stuff
- Spammy pull requests
- Requests that I rebase your branch
- Adding dependencies (unless you have a good reason)

Good coding!!
